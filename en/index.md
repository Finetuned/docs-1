# Welcome to the modmore documentation

If you're looking for information on using the [Premium Extras from modmore](https://modmore.com/extras/), look no further! On this shiny new documentation site, you can read more about how our products work, and what you can make with them.

The navigation on the side allows you to browse the documentation hierarchically. The search at the top is useful if you already know what you're looking for. If you're actually reading _everything_, there's previous and next links at the bottom of the page. 

## Get help

If you still have questions, let us know via support@modmore.com or [post on our community forum](https://forum.modmore.com/). We're here to help! 

## Browse the documentation offline

It's possible to [download a full archive of this website](modmore-documentation.zip) (around 6MB) to browse it offline. After downloading, unpack the zip file into a memorable place. 

You'll get the best results when serving the files on a local web server (apache/nginx). This will allow you to use the entire documentation site exactly like it works on [docs.modmore.com](https://docs.modmore.com/), including a functional search. 

**Note**: Not all images are included in the download. This means that if you're actually offline you might not see relevant screenshots. 

## Improve the documentation

If you're already comfortable with our extras (or you just spotted a typo!), you can help us improving this documentation through [GitHub](https://github.com/modmore/docs). [Read more about contributing to the Documentation](Meta/Contributing_to_Docs).
