Based on an idea by Christian Seel, the free [Quickstart Buttons](https://modmore.com/extras/quickstartbuttons/) package allows you to manage big buttons that show up on the MODX Manager Dashboard.

## Getting Started

1. [Install the package](https://modmore.com/extras/quickstartbuttons/download/)
2. Refresh the page so the top menu is updated.
3. Find Quickstart Buttons in the menu under Extras / Components
4. Edit the buttons set to add/edit items. 
5. Go to System > Dashboards to create a new dashboard. (Tip: right click to duplicate the default)
6. Click Place Widget and choose the Quickstart Buttons widget to add to the dashboard. Save the dashboard. 
5. Go to System > Access Control Lists and on the User Groups & Users tab right click the user group you want to use the new dashboard. 
6. On the General tab, bottom right, choose the new dashboard you created.
7. Go back to the manager dashboard to see your set!
