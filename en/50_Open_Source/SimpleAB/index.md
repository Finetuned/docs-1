[SimpleAB](https://modmore.com/extras/simpleab/) is a tool that allows you to perform A/B tests on chunks and templates in MODX. This is used when trying to improve conversions, to see the impact of specific changes. 

SimpleAB was originally a Premium Extra, but [was made free in August 2016](https://modmore.com/blog/2016/simpleab-free/).
