## Selectbox

Uses the Field Options option on a field to create a dropdown.

This follows the syntax of listbox template variables where options are separated by two pipes (`||`) and display and stored values with two equal signs (`==`), so an example configuration would be:

`Display==Value||Other Display==OtherValue`

If you enable _Process tags in options_ on the field, you can also use chunk or snippet tags to dynamically populate the dropdown. 

For example, you can use getResources to create a simple resource list field. This example lists all resources at the top level of the resource tree.

````html
[[getResources?
    &parents=`0`
    &tpl=`@INLINE [[+pagetitle]]==[[+id]]`
    &outputSeparator=`||`
    &limit=`0`
]]
````

ExtJS Type: `modx-combo` with a local store created from the fields' Input Options. 

## Google Font List

Provides a dropdown with all the available google fonts. You need to set the `clientconfig.google_fonts_api_key` setting with your Google API Key.
