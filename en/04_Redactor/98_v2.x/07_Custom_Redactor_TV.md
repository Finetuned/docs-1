title: Redactor Custom Template Variable
---
 In addition to being able to use Redactor as a Rich Text Editor for your Resource Content, Redactor for MODX comes with a custom Template Variable (input) type. You can create as many Redactor TVs as you need, each with a unique configuration that overrides or inherits the various [Redactor configuration options](Configure_Redactor).

 Simply create a new Template Variable and choose the `redactor` Input Type. You will notice the various input options that you can override, or leave empty to inherit from the system default. For information on each option, [see the configuration reference here.](Configure_Redactor) All configuration options marked with a blue "+TV" tag can be configured for each Template Variable individually.
