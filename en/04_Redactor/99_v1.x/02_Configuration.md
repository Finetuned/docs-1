The page you're currently looking at contains information related to Redactor 1.x. Please visit [Configure Redactor](https://modmore.com/redactor/documentation/configuration/) for the relevant information for Redactor 2.x.

---

Redactor comes with a whole bunch of configuration options, so you can customize the look of the editor, the available functionality and some nifty tricks that Redactor offers.

These configurations are stored as System Settings, and can be found by visiting _System_ » _System Settings_ and choosing _redactor_ in the namespace dropdown (that's the one that defaults to "core"). It is also possible to create [Redactor Template Variables instances](https://modmore.com/extras/redactor/documentation/template-variable/), in which case you can override many of the settings for each template variable.

+tv Options marked with a "+" in the overview, or with the blue "+tv" label below, are options that can be configured for individual [Redactor template variables](https://modmore.com/extras/redactor/documentation/template-variable/).

## User Specific Settings

Redactor for MODX takes advantage of MODX Revolution’s ability to override System Settings with User Settings. This means that you can do things like control what buttons in the toolbar are available for different editors of your site. Maybe you only want some of them have the Source Button. Maybe different colors should be available. Maybe files should be uploaded to user specific folders. Who knows! It’s up to you.



## Editor

The settings in the Editor category allow you to customize functionality related to the editing experience.
