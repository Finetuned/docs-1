Configuration sets are how you manage the configuration for Redactor. They are found in Extras > Redactor Configuration and will show you a live preview of the chosen configuration.

Each set contains all the different options that are available, and can be exported, imported and duplicated. 

Once created, you can assign sets to be used globally, for specific contexts, and for specific template variables. They can also be assigned to [ContentBlocks fields](Usage/ContentBlocks), [template variables](Usage/Template_Variables), and the [resource introtext](Usage/Introtext).

A description of each option is included in the configuration view. For some more complex functionality with more advanced options, additional documentation is available in the [Features section](Features/index).

If you want to share or re-use your favourite configuration sets, you can export and import them from the Redactor Configuration page.
