Redactor also ships with a custom input type for use with [ContentBlocks](https://modmore.com/contentblocks/). 

Similar to the [custom template variable type](Template_Variables), this allows you to set different configuration sets for different fields.

## Creating a Field

With Redactor and ContentBlocks installed, go to Extras > ContentBlocks and create a new field. For the Input Type, choose `Rich Text - Redactor`, located at the bottom of the list.

On the **Properties** tab you can select the configuration set to use.
