Redactor can be used within MIGX.

## Standard Configuration

[By following the MIGX Backend-Usage tutorial](https://docs.modx.com/current/en/extras/migx/migx.backend-usage), you'll get the default Redactor configuration set inside your form. This is because in the Form Tabs, you've defined `"inputTVtype": "richtext"` - which grabs the default editor in the default configuration.

Do not use the "migxredactor" TV type provided by MIGX - that was for Redactor v2.

## MIGX-specific configuration

We're investigating adding support for custom configuration sets inside MIGX.
