Shortcodes allow you to set the block-level element without using the keyboard. It's a great companion to air mode and a power-user feature to keep typing without needing to use the mouse to select formatting options.

To use a shortcode, start typing the shortcode at the start of an empty line. Redactor will recognise the shortcode and adjust the formatting right away.

The following shortcodes are recognised:

- `p.` for a paragraph
- `quote.` for a blockquote
- `pre.` for a code block
- `h1.` for a heading level 1
- `h2.` for a heading level 2
- `h3.` for a heading level 3
- `h4.` for a heading level 4
- `h5.` for a heading level 5
- `h6.` for a heading level 6
- `*.` for an unordered list

Make sure to combine the use of shortcodes with the [available keyboard shortcuts](Shortcuts).
