Digital Signage ships with the following slide types out of the box:

- **Default** which consists of rich text (support Redactor, TinyMCE and other RTEs) and an optional image. 
- **Media** which is either an image or a YouTube/Vimeo video. Best played full screen.
- **RSS Feed** to show a list of items from a RSS feed. ([learn more about different ways of integrating feeds](../RSS_Feeds))
- **Buienradar** integrates the weather forecast, using an API from Buienradar. While Buienradar is a Dutch site, their forecast does have worldwide coverage.
