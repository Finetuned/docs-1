> **This extra is discontinued**. It was originally built by Sterc and distributed by modmore as a Premium Extra, however in 2020 Sterc decided they can no longer offer the support required. It is no longer available from modmore, but may be available elsewhere.
>
> Unfortunately modmore cannot provide standard support for this extra. You may request support from Sterc directly or consider [booking Premium MODX Support](https://modmore.com/premium-modx-support/) if you need help with it.

Digital Signage ships with the following slide types out of the box:

- **Default** which consists of rich text (support Redactor, TinyMCE and other RTEs) and an optional image.
- **Media** which is either an image or a YouTube/Vimeo video. Best played full screen.
- **RSS Feed** to show a list of items from a RSS feed. ([learn more about different ways of integrating feeds](../RSS_Feeds))
- **Buienradar** integrates the weather forecast, using an API from Buienradar. While Buienradar is a Dutch site, their forecast does have worldwide coverage.
