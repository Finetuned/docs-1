> **This extra is discontinued**. It was originally built by Sterc and distributed by modmore as a Premium Extra, however in 2020 Sterc decided they can no longer offer the support required. It is no longer available from modmore, but may be available elsewhere.
>
> Unfortunately modmore cannot provide standard support for this extra. You may request support from Sterc directly or consider [booking Premium MODX Support](https://modmore.com/premium-modx-support/) if you need help with it.

It's possible to create your custom slide types as well. This requires changing your [template](../Custom_Templates) and adding the slide type in the Digital Signage dashboard.

Instructions on how to do that will follow here, soon.
