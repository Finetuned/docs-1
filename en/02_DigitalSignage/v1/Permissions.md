> **This extra is discontinued**. It was originally built by Sterc and distributed by modmore as a Premium Extra, however in 2020 Sterc decided they can no longer offer the support required. It is no longer available from modmore, but may be available elsewhere.
>
> Unfortunately modmore cannot provide standard support for this extra. You may request support from Sterc directly or consider [booking Premium MODX Support](https://modmore.com/premium-modx-support/) if you need help with it.

Digital Signage offers the following permissions that you can use with the MODX ACL system to manage access to the dashboard.

- `digitalsignage` With this policy you can manage slides, broadcasts and media players.
- `digitalsignage_settings` With this policy you can manage slides, broadcasts, media players and slide types.

If you'd like to restrict access to the digital signage component, create a Policy Template with those permissions,
a Policy based on that template, and add the policy as mgr context permission to a usergroup.
