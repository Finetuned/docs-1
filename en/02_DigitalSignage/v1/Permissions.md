Digital Signage offers the following permissions that you can use with the MODX ACL system to manage access to the dashboard.

- `digitalsignage` With this policy you can manage slides, broadcasts and media players.
- `digitalsignage_settings` With this policy you can manage slides, broadcasts, media players and slide types.

If you'd like to restrict access to the digital signage component, create a Policy Template with those permissions, 
a Policy based on that template, and add the policy as mgr context permission to a usergroup.
