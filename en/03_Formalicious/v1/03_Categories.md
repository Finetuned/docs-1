> **This extra is discontinued**. It was originally built by Sterc and distributed by modmore as a Premium Extra, however in 2020 Sterc decided they can no longer offer the support required. It is no longer available from modmore, but may be available elsewhere.
>
> Unfortunately modmore cannot provide standard support for this extra. You may request support from Sterc directly or consider [booking Premium MODX Support](https://modmore.com/premium-modx-support/) if you need help with it.

Organising your forms from the start is highly recommended. You can do this by creating Form Categories. Categories allow you to group forms into tabs.

Create tabs by going to the Formalicious page in the Extras-menu and click on _Admin panel_.

Manage your _Categories_ in the first tab. The category-name will be displayed as the tab-name, followed by the description, which can be used to explain to your users what the category is used for.

**Please be aware:** forms can go missing when removing their parent category. Always make sure a category is empty before removing it. Version 1.1.0 will change this behaviour.
