Formalicious contains one _System Setting_: `formalicious.source`, which defaults to `1`. This is the default _Filesystem_ media source.

Set this to the media source ID you wish to use when selecting email-attachments for auto-replies.

You can find an overview of all your media sources by clicking _Media Sources_ in the _Media_ menu. The first column in the media sources table can be used as the ID of the `formalicious.source` setting.
