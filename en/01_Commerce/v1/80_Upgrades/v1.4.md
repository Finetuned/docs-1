## New: Price Labels

The pricing in Commerce has been extended to support a new price-specific label that can optionally be shown and incorporated in the cart.

At the moment this is only implemented in the **Quantity Price Type**, allowing you to set a different label for certain quantities the customer orders.

To implement this in your cart template ,us something along these lines:

```
{% if item.price_label %}
    <br>
    <small class="c-cart-price-label">{{ item.price_label }}</small>
{% endif %}
```

## New: datefield grid filter

Grid filters can now use a new `datefield` type to filter results on dates.
