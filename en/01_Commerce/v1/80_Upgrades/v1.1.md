Most upgrades are automatically applied, but sometimes you may need to update custom templates, or configuration, to take advantage of new features or improvements. Those changes are discussed here.

Commerce v1.1 introduces new features and developer tools/utilities, but also **cleans up legacy code** that was marked as deprecated before v1.0.

v1.1 also bumps the minimum PHP version to 7.1 as a **hard requirement**, we've incorporated PHP 7.1 features in this release that will break on earlier versions of PHP. When upgrading, the installer will stop automatically if you run a too old version of PHP.

Items marked `[Technical]` only affect module developers. Other items may require action on implementations. 

[TOC]

## New infinite stock

It's now possible to set a product to have infinite stock. To use this in your product templates, [see the product stock documentation](../Products/Stock).

## Updated Stripe, Braintree and Mollie Gateways

The Stripe, Braintree and Mollie gateways have received major updates.

- **Stripe** now uses Payment Intents, which are SCA-ready, supporting 3D Secure and the latest checkout flow for credit cards.
- **Braintree** now uses the Drop-in UI v3, also SCA-ready and supports vaulting credit card/paypal accounts for quicker payment for repeat customers (only for logged in users). 
- **Mollie** can now show more issuers and options on-site, including a new "show" value for the payment option selection that will show all enabled payment methods and their respective issuers in a single view. The default CSS also includes some new styling for this. 

For SCA-readiness of the different gateways we offer, see the [payment methods overview](../Payment_Methods). 

## invoice/web.twig minor tweaks

To make sure the img tag is only created when a logo URL is set, change:

```
<img src="{{ logo_url }}" style="width: 33%" />
```

on line 76 to: 

```
{% if logo_url != '' %}<img src="{{ logo_url }}" style="width: 33%" />{% else %}{{ site_name }}{% endif %}
```

To align the invoice meta block right, add these styles around line 62:

```
table.cells-align-right td, table.cells-align-right th {
    text-align: right;
}
```

and add the `cells-align-right` class to the `<table class="layout">` around line 95. 

To use the right order date, replace:

```
<th>{{ data.order.created_on|date('Y-m-d') }}</th>
```

around line 102 with: 

```
<th>{{ data.order.received_on|date('Y-m-d') }}</th>
```

## [Technical] PriceTypeInterface (breaking) changes

To make it possible to have more powerful select fields on price types, the `getFields` method signature changed. 

This is a breaking change and any custom price type will need to be updated - which luckily is very quick to do.

Previous:

```php
public static function getFields();
```

New:

```php
public static function getFields(\Commerce $commerce);
````

## [Technical] Twig abstracted into new View classes

To avoid future breaking changes, we've deprecated direct access to Twig (previously via `$commerce->twig`/`$commerce->loadTwig()`) and have implemented a new `ViewInterface`/`TwigView`. [You can learn more about how to use the ViewInterface in the documentation.](../Developer/Twig_and_Views)

To access the new View class, use `$commerce->view()`. On the resulting object (guaranteed to be there, so can be chained), you can use `render($template, $placeholders)`, `renderString($stringTemplate, $placeholders)` and `addTemplatesPath($absolutePath)` methods. 

Modules that add custom loaders to Twig should rewrite to `addTemplatesPath` and any code that renders twig templates should refactor to the new `render` and `renderString` methods. 

We will keep the legacy `$twig` variable around until at least v1.3 to give you time to migrate.

The `modmore\Commerce\Pricing\Renderer\TwigRenderer` class accepts either a `\Twig\Environment` or a `ViewInterface` instance for now; support for `\Twig\Environment` will be removed in v1.3.

## [Technical] New Payment Gateway implementations

In v1.1 we've incorporated a brand new way of building payment gateways. The pre-1.1 based exclusively on Omnipay still works, and will continue to work for the time being, but new gateways should be based on the [new classes and interfaces](../Developer/Payment_Gateways) and we'd encourage migrating if there are user benefits to be gained from the more flexible integration. 

## [Technical] comShippingMethod and comOrderShipment changes

To support more powerful shipping implementations, a couple of additions and changes have been made to shipping methods and order shipments.

To clarify, a shipping method controls the pricing and customer selection, while the order shipment controls the delivery and merchant interaction. You'll often need both for more complex integrations. 

- `comOrderShipment.setShippingMethod` signature change. Previously `public function setShippingMethod(comShippingMethod $method)` with a void return, now `public function setShippingMethod(comShippingMethod $method, array $data = [])` with a `true|string|void` return value. When the return is a string, that is considered an error message that will be shown to the customer.
- New `comShippingMethod.getShippingForm(comOrder $order, comOrderShipment $shipment): string` method, allowing you to generate a form shown to the customer. Is automatically called and added to the pre-existing `{{ method.gateway_form }}` placeholder in `shipping-method.twig`. The `getShippingForm()` method may throw a `ViewException` if it can't be rendered, which will discard the shipping method as an available option.
- New `comOrderShipment.getShipmentDetails(): array` method to define key => value pairs of additional shipping information to show in the order items grid.
- New `comOrderShipment.getTrackingURL(): string` method to define a track and trace URL, available both to the merchant in the order view and in outgoing emails.
