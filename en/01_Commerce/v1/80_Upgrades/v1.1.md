Most upgrades are automatically applied, but sometimes you may need to update custom templates, or configuration, to take advantage of new features or improvements. Those changes are discussed here.

Commerce v1.1 introduces new features and developer tools/utilities, but also **cleans up legacy code** that was marked as deprecated before v1.0.

v1.1 also bumps the minimum PHP version to 7.1 as a **hard requirement**, we've incorporated PHP 7.1 features in this release that will break on earlier versions of PHP. When upgrading, the installer will stop automatically if you run a too old version of PHP.

Items marked `[Technical]` only affect module developers. Other items may require action on implementations.

## New Stripe Card Gateway

We've added a new `Stripe - Card` gateway. If you're using the pre-1.1 version of the Stripe gateway (now renamed to Stripe - Legacy), you'll want to consider switching to take advantage of the [new SCA-ready Payment Intents integration](../Payment_Methods/Stripe_Card). We'll keep the legacy gateway around until at least v1.3.

## [Technical] Twig abstracted into new View classes

To avoid future breaking changes, we've deprecated direct access to Twig (previously via `$commerce->twig`/`$commerce->loadTwig()`) and have implemented a new `ViewInterface`/`TwigView`. [You can learn more about how to use the ViewInterface in the documentation.](../Developer/Twig_and_Views)

To access the new View class, use `$commerce->view()`. On the resulting object, you can use `render($template, $placeholders)`, `renderString($stringTemplate, $placeholders)` and `addTemplatesPath($absolutePath)` methods. 

Modules that add custom loaders to Twig should rewrite to `addTemplatesPath` and any code that renders twig templates should refactor to the new `render` and `renderString` methods. We will keep the legacy `$twig` variable around until at least v1.3 to give you timeto migrate.

The `modmore\Commerce\Pricing\Renderer\TwigRenderer` class accepts either a `\Twig\Environment` or a `ViewInterface` instance for now; support for `\Twig\Environment` will be removed in v1.3.

## [Technical] New Payment Gateway implementations

In v1.1 we've incorporated a brand new way of building payment gateways. The pre-1.1 based exclusively on Omnipay still works, and will continue to work for the time being, but new gateways should be based on the [new classes and interfaces](../Developer/Payment_Gateways).
