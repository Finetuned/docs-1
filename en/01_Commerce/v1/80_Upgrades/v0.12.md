Most upgrades are automatically applied, but sometimes you may need to update custom templates, or status configuration, to take advantage of new features or improvements. Those changes are discussed here.

**Most changes listed in this migration document are optional.**

## New shop_resource setting

Previously, an empty cart would link to the site_start setting, but now in 0.12 we're linking to a new commerce.shop_resource setting instead. This is useful to change where the customer is sent without needing to create a custom template just for that.

To tweak this in existing custom templates, edit your
`frontend/checkout/cart.twig` template, around line 28, from:

```` twig
<p><a href="[[~[[++site_start]]]]">{{ lex('commerce.cart.no_items_yet') }} {{ lex('commerce.cart.continue_shopping') }}</a></p>
````
```` twig
<p><a href="{{ shop_root_url }}">{{ lex('commerce.cart.no_items_yet') }} {{ lex('commerce.cart.continue_shopping') }}</a></p>
````

The `{{ shop_root_url }}` placeholder is available throughout the entire checkout.

## Add to cart now in the lexicon

You can now use `[[%commerce.add_to_cart]]` (in MODX templates) or `{{ lex('commerce.add_to_cart') }}` in your add to cart forms. This is not required, but will automatically be translated for you in supported languages.
