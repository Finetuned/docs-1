Most upgrades are automatically applied, but sometimes you may need to update custom templates, or status configuration, to take advantage of new features or improvements. Those changes are discussed here.

**Most changes listed in this migration document are optional.**

[TOC]

## New shop_resource setting

Previously, an empty cart would link to the site_start setting, but now in 0.12 we're linking to a new commerce.shop_resource setting instead. This is useful to change where the customer is sent without needing to create a custom template just for that.

To tweak this in existing custom templates, edit your
`frontend/checkout/cart.twig` template, around line 28, from:

```` twig
<p><a href="[[~[[++site_start]]]]">{{ lex('commerce.cart.no_items_yet') }} {{ lex('commerce.cart.continue_shopping') }}</a></p>
````
```` twig
<p><a href="{{ shop_root_url }}">{{ lex('commerce.cart.no_items_yet') }} {{ lex('commerce.cart.continue_shopping') }}</a></p>
````

The `{{ shop_root_url }}` placeholder is available throughout the entire checkout.

## Add to cart now in the lexicon

You can now use `[[!%commerce.add_to_cart]]` (in MODX templates) or `{{ lex('commerce.add_to_cart') }}` in your add to cart forms. This is not required, but will automatically be translated for you in supported languages.

## New email notes on shipping and payment methods

It's now possible to configure notes on shipping and payment methods, which are automatically added to the email sent to the customer.

If you have a custom `emails/order-received.twig` template, add the following placeholders where you want those messages to show up; in the default they're around line 335 following `{{ lex('commerce.email.order_rcvd.footnote') }}`:

````html
{{ payment_method_note }}
{{ shipping_method_note }}
````

## Cart resource now used instead of checkout resource

Previously, when you submitted a form on the cart resource (add a coupon, change/remove items), it would end up sending you to the checkout resource. Similarly, using the steps navigation on the checkout page would leave you on the checkout resource.

As of 0.12, if you have separate cart and checkout resources, any cart request will be handled by the cart resource. So changing an order item will redirect you back to the cart, instead of the cart resource. 

Particularly for users with JavaScript checkout systems, please validate your cart and checkout still behave as you expect them to.
