Most upgrades are automatically applied, but sometimes you may need to update custom templates, or status configuration, to take advantage of new features or improvements. Those changes are discussed here.

The most notable changes in v1.0 revolve around the way [product pricing and currencies are handled](../Products/Price_Types). This has resulted in some breaking changes, detailed before.

## [DEV] CountryField.getCountries signature change

The `getCountries method no longer requires you to provide the Commerce class to it.`

## [DEV] Grids now escape all columns by default

_This only affects developers of custom modules._

We're now automatically escaping all grid columns by default. This avoids any XSS vulnerabilities from making their way into the dashboard. 

To allow HTML in columns (e.g. to enable links), add `'raw' => true` to your array-style column definition, or use the new way of defining `Column`s with the `raw` option. 

When you've marked a column as raw, it is up to you to make sure any contents in it is properly escaped. A new utility `$this->encode($value)` is now available to grid widgets to help. 

## [DEV] Country dependency introduced breaking change

_This only affects developers of custom modules._

The `CommerceGuys\Intl\Country\CountryRepository` utility that has been available for a while has been updated, which suffered breaking changes. That data has moved to a different package, `CommerceGuys\Addressing\Country\CountryRepository`, which luckily does have the same signatures. 

To prevent such breakage in the future, we've implemented a new `Countries` utility that gives you the same functionality but in a native package that restricts your usage to native classes.
