title: SimpleCart or Commerce?
---

Not sure which e-commerce solution to use, and doubting between SimpleCart and Commerce? Simple, [use Commerce](https://modmore.com/commerce).

## Pricing 

Yes, Commerce costs a bit more. It's also capable of so much more.

When building a webshop, you need to start with a reliable foundation that can be extended when your clients' business wants to try something new. You also want as much plug and play functionality as possible, but only as optional features when you need them.
 
SimpleCart simply cannot offer any of that; but it is literally what we had in mind when building Commerce.

If the license fee for Commerce is holding you back from using it, [non-profit discounts are available](https://modmore.com/commerce/pricing/non-profit/). 

Also note that we're able of providing a lot more support for Commerce compared to SimpleCart thanks to the higher license price.

## Feature comparison

- Payment provider integrations? [Commerce has 10 (and counting) plug and play payment integrations](https://docs.modmore.com/en/Commerce/v1/Payment_Methods/index.html#page_Available+Payment+Gateways). [SimpleCart has 5](https://docs.modmore.com/en/SimpleCart/v2.x/Payment_Methods/index.html), each of which is also available for Commerce.

- Flexible shipping methods? [Commerce has 3 different shipping method types built-in](https://docs.modmore.com/en/Commerce/v1/Shipping_Methods.html), including based on weight and destination country, plus 3 other types available as installable extensions. SimpleCart is limited to a fixed or percentage-based shipping fee. 

- Need to get data out of your shop? Commerce ships with [a bunch of different reports and exports covering a wide range of data](https://docs.modmore.com/en/Commerce/v1/Reports.html) (which is also extendable), while SimpleCart is limited to a single CSV export of basic order information.

- Don't like taxes? Neither do we, but Commerce does support powerful [tax rules with automatic tax rates for the US and EU](https://docs.modmore.com/en/Commerce/v1/Taxes.html), inclusive/exclusive product prices, and the ability to show accurate tax calculation before the customer enters their billing information using geolocation or default addresses. Shipping costs are taxed, too, unlike with SimpleCart. 

- Special product prices? [Price types in Commerce](https://docs.modmore.com/en/Commerce/v1/Products/Price_Types.html) gives you sale, bulk/quantity, user, and user group product prices. And yes, custom price types can be integrated as well. 

- CRM/ERP integration? While there are no plug and play integrations currently available for either, Commerce does support retrieving product information from an external source and includes dozens of events to implement bi-directional synchronisation. 

- Powerful fulfillment workflows, including label generation, printing packing sheets, invoicing, or custom integrations? [Commerce offers a very powerful status workflow system with the ability to fire any action at any step in the process.](https://docs.modmore.com/en/Commerce/v1/Statuses/index.html)

- Stock management? SimpleCart does not restrict purchases to the available stock, Commerce does. 

We could go on - but you probably get the point.
 
The only thing SimpleCart does better than Commerce is being _simple_. 

There's much less to learn in SimpleCart, so if you have very limited requirements, a very short deadline, and no experience with either systems, then you may be quicker to launch with SimpleCart. 

In such a scenario though, we do suggest taking advantage of the opportunity to dive head-first into the powers of Commerce, immersing yourself with all it has to offer. 

And also: take liberal use of our email support. We have your back, and have already helped dozens of agencies and similar numbers of freelance developers getting up to speed with all that Commerce has to offer. You can also [use our Commerce starter pack](https://modmore.com/commerce/extensions/theme-red/) to get a fully functional catalog and custom checkout theme from a simple package installation, ready to be customised. 

## Community

The MODX community is definitely embracing Commerce. Half of the available extensions for Commerce have been made by third-party developers. 

Commerce has also overtaken SimpleCart in terms of installations, even though SimpleCart has been available for several years longer than Commerce.

## Already using SimpleCart?

Don't worry - we'll continue to provide bug fixes and support for SimpleCart. We don't have major (re-)developments planned for it, but we'll do what we can to make sure it's stable.

If you're looking to migrate a SimpleCart shop to Commerce, we're happy to offer you a â‚¬50 discount on the Commerce license. (Only for SimpleCart licenses bought from modmore, or for older licenses with a support extension.)
