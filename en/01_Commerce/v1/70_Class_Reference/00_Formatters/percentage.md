The `percentage` formatter takes in a floating decimal number (up to 10 decimals) and returns a number formatted value with only the number of decimals necessary, and a `%` suffix.

For example, inputting `15.2450000` returns `15.245%` and `99` returns `99%`.

The decimal point and thousands separator are taken from the currently active currency based on context or system configuration.
