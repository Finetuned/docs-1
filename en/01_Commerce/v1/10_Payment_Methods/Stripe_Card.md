[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) offers on-site credit card payments with a JavScript client. 

The `Stripe - Card` payment gateway was added in v1.1 and uses the Stripe Payment Intents API to complete transactions. 

## Creating a Stripe Payment Method

See [Payment Methods](../Payment_Methods) for the basics of creating a payment method.

Stripe requires a Secret Key and Publishable key to be configured, both of which can be found under [Account Settings > API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys) in the Stripe dashboard.
