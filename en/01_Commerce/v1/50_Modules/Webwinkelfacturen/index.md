## Costs

Webwinkelfacturen charges a yearly subscription fee, based on the number of transactions. At the time of writing, this begins at €72 + VAT per year. You will start with a 30 day free trial before [choosing your plan](https://www.webwinkelfacturen.nl/prijzen).

As modmore does not receive any sort of affiliate or kickback fee from that subscription to maintain our end of the integration long-term, we offer the integration as a Premium Extension, with a one-time purchase fee starting at €89 + VAT. That includes our standard support. You can [buy licenses here](https://modmore.com/commerce/extensions/webwinkelfacturen/).

Your accounting software may also incur costs.

## Initial Setup

The initial setup involves signing up for Webwinkelfacturen with the accounting integration you're looking for and setting up the Commerce extension. [Detailed steps are available here](Setup).
