Commerce doesn't have the concept of product variations. Instead, different variations of a product are simply unique product records with their own name, SKU, description, price, stock etc. 

To show different product options to your customers, you'd integrate using the [Product List TV](../Product_Catalog/Products_TV) or [Product Matrix TV](../Product_Catalog/Product_Matrix). 

Depending on your integration path, the [commerce.get_products](../Snippets/get_products) or [commerce.get_matrix](../Snippets/get_matrix) snippets can then be used to let the user choose. 

Also see [Product Catalog in the Getting Started section](../Getting_Started/Product_Catalog) for more information about how to work with products, resources, and the different TVs we offer in Commerce.
