If you'd like to change the text and buttons in the consent management window, you can use the MODX lexicon system. 

In the Manager, navigate to System (cog icon) > Lexicons. Select `consentfriend` as the namespace, `web` as area, and the language you want to change it for.

Next double click on the value of any of the strings to edit them. ConsentFriend will automatically load your changes into the front-end, and changes made this way will also persist across updates.
