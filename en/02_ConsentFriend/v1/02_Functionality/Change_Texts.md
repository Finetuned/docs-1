If you'd like to change the text and buttons in the consent management window, you can use the MODX lexicon system. 

In the Manager, navigate to System (cog icon) > Lexicons. Select `consentfriend` as the namespace, `web` as area, and the language you want to change it for.

Double click on the value of any of the strings to edit them and **clear the MODX cache** for changes to appear in the front-end.

Changes made this way will also persist across updates.
