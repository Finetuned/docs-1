title: Icons in ContentBlocks
---

ContentBlocks ships with a lot of icons by default. These cover most use cases and input types that are included in the core, as well as a bunch of icons for different layout configurations.

These icons were designed specifically for ContentBlocks by Jon Wallace Design.

## Included Icons

All icons will be shown in the Icons dropdown when adding a field or layout, but in case you want a separate look, here they are:

All these icons are retina-ready too (not on this page), so should look great on your fancy screens as well.

## Custom Icons

To load custom icons, simply upload them to the assets/components/contentblocks/img/icons/ directory. The image needs to:

- be a png file and end in the .png extension
- be 80x80px in size.
- have a @2x variety at 160x160px for retina screens, so if you have customicon1.png, you will also need customicon1@2x.png that is twice the size.
- look pretty.

If you made a wicked custom input that you want to distribute and you need an icon for it, get in touch. We might be able to help with a free icon.

## Creating Custom Icons

To aid with creating custom icons, Max Mitchell wrote a shell script that is available on GitHub that will automatically build new icons for you. It will take your input images/icons, and place them on top of the right background and in the right size. [Check it out here](https://github.com/mazuhl/cb-icon-maker).
